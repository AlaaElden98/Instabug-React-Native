## Installation
This section explains how to install Instabug SDK into your React Native application.

1. Open the terminal and navigate to your React Native Directory. Then run the following command.

```bash
npm install instabug-reactnative
```

2. Link the bridging files in the npm package to the ios project use the following command.
```bash
react-native link instabug-reactnative
```
3. Add Instabug SDK to your iOS project by adding this to your [**Podfile**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html) (You can skip this step if you are building an Android app only).
```bash
pod 'Instabug', '~> 7.0'
```
4.Then run the following command (You can skip this step if you are building an Android app only).
```bash
pod install
```
CocoaPods will download and install the SDK and add all the required dependencies into your ios project.

## Using Instabug
1. To start using Instabug, import it into your `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js` file.

```javascript
import Instabug from 'instabug-reactnative';
```
2. Then initialize it in the `constructor` or `componentWillMount`. This line will let the Instabug SDK work with the default behavior. The SDK will be invoked when the device is shaken. You can customize this behavior through the APIs (You can skip this step if you are building an Android app only).

```javascript
Instabug.startWithToken('IOS_APP_TOKEN', Instabug.invocationEvent.shake);
```
3. Open `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
   You should find the getPackages method looks like the following snippet. You just need to add your Android app token (You can skip this step if you are building an iOS app only).
```javascript
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
	return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
	new MainReactPackage(),
	new RNInstabugReactnativePackage("ANDROID_APP_TOKEN",MainApplication.this,"shake","#1D82DC"));
}
```
You can find your app token by selecting the SDK tab from your [**Instabug dashboard**](https://dashboard.instabug.com/app/sdk/).
